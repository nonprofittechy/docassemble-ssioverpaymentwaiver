question: |
  Social Security Overpayment Waiver or Change
subquestion: |
  This website can help you ask the Social Security administration to 
  
  1. **lower the amount that must be paid back**, or;
  1. **change the schedule of payments** for someone who is told that they
  owe the Social Security Administration money.
  
  ${ collapse_template(overpayment_waiver_help_template) }

  #### Before you get started

  Use this website if you agree that you owe the Social Security
  Administration. If you do not agree, you should file an 
  [appeal](https://secure.ssa.gov/iApplNMD/start) instead.
  
  ${ collapse_template(appeal_help_template) }
  
  Before you start, you should find:
  
  1. The notice from Social Security that says that you owe money.
  1. Information about the money that you get each month, and the money that
  people who live with you get.
  1. Find out if you get SSI, SSDI, or both.
  1. Information about how you save and spend money, such as bank statements
  and bills.
  
  This form will also ask for your Social Security number. We keep your
  information safe. Click below to learn more.

  More information about an overpayment waiver
content: |
  When Social Security says that you have an overpayment they are saying that you got more SSI or SSDI than you should have gotten under their rules. The reason Social Security says you have an overpayment is in the Notice of Overpayment. 
  
  If you agree with Social Security that you have an overpayment but you believe it wasn’t your fault and you can’t afford to pay it back you can ask Social Security for a Waiver. A Waiver means that you don’t have to pay back the overpayment. This interview is to help you fill out a form to ask for a Waiver of the overpayment.

subject: |
  More information about appeals
content: |
  If you do NOT agree with Social Security that you have an overpayment or if you do not understand the reasons Social Security said you have an overpayment, you can file an appeal of the overpayment. The appeal is called a Request for Reconsideration.  
  
  The deadline for filing the appeal is 60 days from the date you got your overpayment notice from Social Security. You must act quickly if you want to appeal. 
  
  If you got an overpayment notice after going back to work while you were on SSI or SSDI, you may be able to get legal advice from the Disability Law Center. Call them at ${tel("617-723-8455") } or ${ tel("1-800-872-9992") }. They may be able to help you decide if you should file an appeal or a waiver. 
  
  You can [start your appeal online](https://secure.ssa.gov/iApplNMD/start) or by filling out the [Request for Reconsideration form](https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ssa-561-u2.pdf) and sending it to your [local Social Security office](https://www.ssa.gov/open/data/FO-RS-Address-Open-Close-Time-App-Devs.html).

  Not sure we will leave this in--somewhat in the nature

  You said you only are asking the Social Security Administration

  to complete form SSA-634.
  
  Form SSA-634 is a little simpler and asks fewer questions.

id: exit dont agree overpaid
decoration: hand-paper
question: |
  This may not be the right form for you.
subquestion: |
  This form is used when you want the Social Security Administration to waive or reduce the amount you owe them.
  
  If you don't agree with the Social Security Administration that an overpayment happened, you may want to appeal the overpayment instead. It's a good idea to talk to a lawyer. For help finding legal aid, visit the [Legal Services Corporation](https://www.lsc.gov/what-legal-aid/find-legal-aid).
  
  If you received the letter from the Social Security Administration notifying you of the overpayment more than 65 days ago, it is too late for you to file an appeal. If it is too late for you to file an appeal and you don’t agree that an overpayment happened, you should still proceed by selecting "Keep going" to request the Social Security Administration waive or reduce the amount you owe them.

  If the Social Security Administration says that more than one person has to

  If you think you and the other person may disagree about whose fault the
  overpayment was, it may be safest for you each to use your own forms.

  The Social Security administration will ask you to pay back the ${currency(possess_overpayment_amount, decimals=False)}
  that you said you still have from the overpayment. If that is less than the full 
  amount of the overpayment you may still need to pay back more, but you can ask for a 
  payment plan that works for you.
