question: |
  Social Security Overpayment Waiver or Change
subquestion: |
  This interview is for someone who has to pay back money to the Social Security
  Administration (SSA). This money is called an "overpayment".
  
  You can use this interview to ask the SSA to let you pay back less money.
  You can also ask them to let you have more time to pay them back.
  
  You might need to tell the SSA a lot about how you and people who depend on you
  earn and spend money. You should get your bank statements, utility bills, and 
  any pay stubs ready before you start.
  
  You will need to put your Social Security Number on this form. You are the only
  person who can see it before you print and mail or deliver it. We will keep
  your private information safe. 
  
  Click help to learn more.

  Not sure we will leave this in--somewhat in the nature
  of debugging for now. But could be useful for transparency.
id: explain ssa 634
question: |
  We'll complete form SSA-634 for you
subquestion: |
  You said you only are asking the Social Security Administration
  to change the amount you pay each month. That means we only need
  to complete form SSA-634.
  
  Form SSA-634 is a little simpler and asks fewer questions.

id: exit dont agree overpaid
decoration: hand-paper
question: |
  This may not be the right form for you.
subquestion: |
  This form is used when you want the Social Security Administration to lower
  the amount you owe them.
  If you don't agree with the Social Security that an overpayment happened, you may 
  want to appeal the overpayment instead. It's a good idea to talk to a lawyer.

question: |
  Is anyone else using this form with you?
subquestion: |
  If the Social Security Administration says that more than one person has to
  pay them back, they can use this form with you.
  
  If you think you and the other person may disagree about whose fault the

  Social Security Administration to waive the overpayment?
