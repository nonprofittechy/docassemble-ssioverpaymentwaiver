question: |
  Overpayment Waiver or Change in Repayment Rate
subquestion: |
  If Social Security says you owe them money, this website can help you ask Social Security to: 
  
  1. **waive an overypayment**, meaning that you don’t have to pay the money back, or
  1. **lower the repayment rate**, meaning that you have to pay less back to Social Security every month
  
  **Use this website if you agree that you owe Social Security**. 
  If you do not agree, you should file an 
  [appeal](https://secure.ssa.gov/iApplNMD/start).
  
  ${ collapse_template(appeal_help_template) }
  
  Before you start, you should find:
  
  1. The notice from Social Security that says that you owe money.
  1. Information about the money that you get each month, and the money that
  people who live with you get.
  1. Find out if you get SSI, SSDI, or both.
  1. Information about how you save and spend money, such as bank statements
  and bills.

  More information about an overpayment waiver
content: |
  When Social Security says that you have an overpayment they are saying that you got more SSI or SSDI than you should have gotten under their rules. The reason Social Security says you have an overpayment is in the Notice of Overpayment. 
  
  If you agree with Social Security that you have an overpayment but you believe it wasn’t your fault and you can’t afford to pay it back you can ask Social Security for a Waiver. A Waiver means that you don’t have to pay back the overpayment. This interview is to help you fill out a form to ask for a Waiver of the overpayment.

  More information about appeals
content: |
  If you do NOT agree with Social Security that you have an overpayment or if you do not understand the reasons Social Security said you have an overpayment, you can file an appeal of the overpayment. The appeal is called a Request for Reconsideration.  
  
  The deadline for filing the appeal is 60 days from the date you got your overpayment notice from Social Security. You must act quickly if you want to appeal. 
  
  If you got an overpayment notice after going back to work while you were on SSI or SSDI, you may be able to get legal advice from the Disability Law Center. Call them at ${tel("617-723-8455") } or ${ tel("1-800-872-9992") }. They may be able to help you decide if you should file an appeal or a waiver. 
  
  You can [start your appeal online](https://secure.ssa.gov/iApplNMD/start) or by filling out the [Request for Reconsideration form](https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ssa-561-u2.pdf) and sending it to your [local Social Security office](https://www.ssa.gov/open/data/FO-RS-Address-Open-Close-Time-App-Devs.html).

id: exit dont agree overpaid
decoration: hand-paper
question: |
  This may not be the right form for you.
subquestion: |
  This form is used when you want the Social Security Administration to waive or reduce the amount you owe them.
  
  If you don’t agree with the Social Security Administration that an overpayment happened or you’re not sure, you may want to [appeal the overpayment](https://secure.ssa.gov/iApplNMD/start) instead. But you must act quickly because there are time limits for filing an appeal. You can [start your appeal](https://secure.ssa.gov/iApplNMD/start) on Social Security's website.
  
  If you appeal you can also ask for a waiver now or at any time later. If you want to save your work on the waiver request, you’ll need to create an account.
  
  It’s a good idea to talk to a lawyer if you want to appeal. If you live in Massachusetts, visit the [Legal Resource Finder](https://masslrf.org) to find legal help. For help finding legal aid in other states, visit the [Legal Services Corporation](https://www.lsc.gov/what-legal-aid/find-legal-aid).
  
  If you received the Notice of Overpayment more than 65 days ago, it may be too late for you to file an appeal unless you had a good reason for missing the deadline. 

  If it is too late for you to file an appeal and you don’t agree that an overpayment happened, click “Keep going” to finish the request for a waiver.
